Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a _Frontend Developer & UI/UX Designer_ based out of Mumbai, India.

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for writing code and making things on the web look pretty. I'm well acquainted with various _UX design_ & _research methods_ as well as _frontend_ & _backend_. I have always been a firm believer in the human element of design and knowing your audience. Therefore, I strive to create simple yet asthetic, functional, minimalistic and impactful user experiences. I primarily code in **React** and **Javascript/Typescript**, and use **Figma** and **AdobeXD** for designing.

In my free time, I love to play video games, watch football ⚽, cook, watch some movies and explore new things in internet.
